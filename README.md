### Overview
The framework of this analysis is to visualize the [Top Selling Switch Games](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chrisckw/nintendo-switch-video-games-sales-analysis/data) dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset provides multiple input variables which were utilized to create several visualizations, variables including;
- Title
- copies_sold
- genre
- developer
- publisher
- as_of
- release_date

Key events to consider when analyzing this dashboard are the release date of the Nintendo Switch console (March 3rd, 2017) and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 which led to a high demand in entertainment products and services including Nintendo Switch consoles, games, and Nintendo Switch Online.

### Reults

The initial spike is due to the initial interest and demand for a new iteration in Nintendo's gaming consoles and its launch titles.

Coming in second place is "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" which released in March 2020; around the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though this title being launched during the pandemic contributed to its sales, it was already a hotly anticipated game.

There are however, as mentioned before, several outliers to this including the launch of the Nintendo Switch console in Q1 of 2017, and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q1 of 2020.


### Summary
The Nintendo Switch is the third best-selling gaming console of all time, right behind Sony's Playstation 2 (launched 2000) at #1 and the Nintendo DS (launched 2004) at #2. It has only been 6 years (at the time of this analysis) since the Nintendo Switch has launched, so it is possible that it could overtake the other two consoles. It is worth considering that with the development of new games requiring stronger hardware, the Nintendo Switch is starting to age and is unable to keep up with third-party developed games, and even some first-party games. Nintnedo has since launched two variations of its console including the Nintendo Switch Lite and Nintendo Switch OLED, which introduced cosmetic changes, but no changes to hardware. Given the life-cycle of modern consoles, it is likely that the Nintendo Switch will be supported for at least the next four or five years, but Nintendo is likely to have a new console in development as the successor to the Switch.
